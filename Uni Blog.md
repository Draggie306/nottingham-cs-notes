# First Steps
- Welcome Week
	- There are many horror stories online about the friends that you make in the freshers week are not the friends that you end the year with. Fortunately for me that was not the case. From the very first tutorial and lecture, I was fortunate to meet someone else who was funny and I could chat to, and we ended up discussing for quite a while after the first tutorial. 
	- Group chats were made and this one friend became two.
	- Finding friends has never been my strongest point but the best friends I have made historically have been there from the start - sitting next to you in day one of Year 12 classes, being there on the first day in the playground. I was comfortable.
	- Two became three. 

# It Gets Worse
- Going from “asking for extensions” quickly became “stop giving me extensions!”.

# A Wave of Hope
After 11 weeks of worsening and worsening morale, it was over. No more coursework due for months. A week left. Putting everything down, communal activities in the accommodation being used, we played some games - for once.

# It (still) Gets Worse
Christmas holidays were not much of a holiday. I managed three days where I ”switched off” - Christmas Day, Boxing Day and the day after. The rest of the time my mind was in coursework mode.
- all 5 modules had the deliberately hardest coursework set.

I was left with no choice. **For the first time I think ever, I had to give up** — and I didn’t take likely to doing that. The bowling score calculator? 2% obtained. The assembly language module that I spent AGES on, trying to nail weeks in advance like the previous coursework I enjoyed? I had to settle for 63%. At least I got full marks (first try) on the networks coursework. My beloved networks coursework.

Did I mention there were also exams immediately as we go back?
# Still Worsening
3 days. This was the gap between the last coursework deadline and the first exam. *Over Christmas*.


# A Breath of Fresh Air

At Nottingham - at least for CS - there are 2 completely different sets of modules - 5 in S1, 5 in S2. I had heard that S2 modules are better, slightly less fast paced than S1 with less continuous assessment. 

By this point, I had done some independent organisation with a particular friend from another, slightly more prestigious, educational establishment that also coincided with being closer to home. In fact, I was so inspired and excited to go, I made one of my favourite websites so far: [Stories](stories.ibaguette.com), and its first accompanying story/entry: [Morning at Caius](caius.md), out of boredom in a mathematics lecture.

# The Best Day Out Ever
> I am not sure why this was so meaningful for me.

The week of the 10th March was an exciting one. I was rushing to complete my coursework, one for AI and one Maths (for the bane of my existence) for one reason. By Wednesday I was deviating to explaining how to do French A Level past paper translations in the computer lab and by Thursday it was time for the final checks. The time had come.

Friday, 7am. The earliest time I had woken up thus far. Breakfast after a clean sweep of my room, taking a bag with some chocolates, a book to survive the weekend, and another bag of clothes. 30 minutes later I rushed to the Atrium for my breakfast and 10 minutes later I was off to the train station - a nice 4km walk for a train at 8:41. Although Google Maps said I’d be 10 mins late, was 15m early.
- Ely at half 10. 
- Walked around, geocached, saw the cathedral which i remember reading about in primary school.
- Almost missed the next train - London king’s cross.
- Onwards to **Cambridge**.
- It’s amazing how you can judge the quality of a place by its train station alone. Cambridge North was pretty nice but the central one is another level.
- It’s common knowledge that near trainstation - worst area. Cambridge was the opposite.
