There is such a sheer amount of (incomprehensible) content to get through, each lecture feels like a speedrun. There is no time to write notes or explain formulas/equations, leading to having to rewatch the content 2/3 times to make just adequate notes. Practicing the content is another "equation" (see what I did there) completely. Punishing content and weekly quizzes that have to be done, without much time between other modules and their respective assignments which require considerable time too, leading to an unmanageable workload that quickly spirals out of control.

Would be good to fully explain topics in lectures. Tutorials generally good but can sometimes be overwhelming when blitzing through the more complex content. Weekly assignments and content started very difficult but were somewhat manageable, towards the end becoming too difficult and barely understandable. Felt disadvantaged not having done A-level maths so would be good to have this gap bridged in a more accessible way and refresher on the specific way of thinking required for maths.

Fascinating and very precise way of thought for assembly that feels good to learn and master with the challenging but equally rewarding (maybe not quite 'fun' or 'enjoyable') when they are completed

feels weird not getting coursework for a few months when started, would be good to have some (very small value but longer deadline) pieces during this time so we know what is generally likely to be with the bigger courseworks and exam.

felt very surprised when doing the first coursework, like it was nothing I had been predicting/thinking about/working through when watching and making notes on the lectures. Little extra material supplied for nand2tetris and difficult to find online, unlike with the COMP1054 instruction sheet. Also forgot to mention the following about the maths survey: felt like dropping out a few times trying to understand the maths.
