69% of YII placement students were offered a graduate position at their placement company. If not, you will have 1 year of experience: compared to other graduates, makes it more attractive and valuable.

## The Degree
First year is identical (as always). 
Start thinking here about what you want to do. 

Careers office - workshop in June running spotlight on placements. 

### In Y2
Need to find placement, with careers fairs in October and sessions next Autumn Semester. Videos, database and presesntations from Y4 students offered to us then.

Katie and Christian (Part of office): how to write good CV, assessment centre, interview, deal with fav job rejection.

Placement will need to be approved by YII tutor (Kris). Apply, get in, accept, then approved.

Requirements: 
- must be related to computer science
- must be a full-time position
- must be 9 months in duration (nothing less)
- Paperwork: placement agreement, health and safety, employers’ insurance certificates.

If not approved (before start of YII component): you must transfer back to degree without YII component.

Most apply this Autumn, most get the job in early Spring. Most say start apply earlier

Primary responsibility is with the company working for. Will have manager etc.

Still enrolled as a student at UoN. Still have access to email (and must keep regular contact). Have access to Cripps, Libraries and Sports services.

At start, submit placement goals (1hr). Every month, submit monthly logs like a diary. At end, submit reflection (all on Moodle).

Company visits: in semester 1 and semester 2, on teams, with me, YII tutor, and manager.

Company will help get work visa. Uni helps with advice for job offers, but generally provides just database for videos, etc.

56 did a placement, 15 wanted but didn’t (may have changed their minds). Around 15/70 (<20%)
