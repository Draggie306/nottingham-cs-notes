Hi everyone, I’m now studying CS at a Russell Group uni, but have made public lots of free resources that I wrote a few years ago and got me Grade 9s at GCSE and As at A Level. For Computer Science, they are all 1:1 matched to the OCR specification and include absolutely everything needed to cover all the content. I call it a “cheat sheet” - condense information that covers every topic, detailed in the parts that people find hardest, whilst trying not to be overly verbose or confusing, all to get the highest band answers and ultimately your Grade 9.Paper 1 is available at: https://ibaguette.com/cheatsheets/gcse/computerscience/paper1 . Paper 2 or both papers combined are also available: https://ibaguette.com/cheatsheets/gcse/computerscience .Although they’ve been public for a while, I’ve just made a range of changes across them all to ensure they’re completely accurate and comprehensible for all. If you want to go further to nail the top grade, I’ve also included links and extra explanations from across the internet (or just taken from my A Level Cheat Sheet) that should really help your knowledge.Other Cheat Sheets for subjects like Geography are also on the site!I really hope they are useful - I’ve read quite a few messages from people saying they are, and I hope they keep coming :)Wishing everyone good luck and hopefully there are no diabolically worded or obscure questions this year (looking at you, OCR).Untitled 6
