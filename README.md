# nottingham-cs-notes
All my notes for the University of Nottinghamâ€™s Computer Science (with Artificial Intelligence) BSc honours programme. Files are automatically updated at midnight UK time every day.


## Automation
Every night at midnight, a cron job on my homelab syncs a S3-compatible storage bucket that contains my notes in Obsidian (powered by Remotely Save) to this Git repo, and pushes them. Then, a Jekyll build is started on GitHub which deploys the new and updated notes to the GitHub Pages site, visible on this page. 

> If the homelab is off (which should be never) then this repository will not be updated; usually, this should only be the case for a few days at most.

> Sometimes I write notes in a hurry and this (especially for mathematics notes) causes the Jekyll build to fail. I am notified when this happens and notes are usually fixed for the next day; if this persists, feel free to open a PR. It should be an easy fix.
