Changes on seasonality (affecting subsistence farming), regional pests migrating into previously unaffected regions, food security

To understand if it is changing, we need to define a baseline to understand whether it is natural vs human-induced (greenhouse gases).

To do this, we may need regional, global, or a specific river catchment/delta. Specific types of **archive** can reveal different changes over time. *This is needed as human records only go back so far, archaeological records go back farther.*

### Data archives
Climate change (since 1800): Different records come in at different times, such as surface air temperatures 

- We can look at photographic archives to see glacial positions over time, such as alpine glaciers. 
- Archaeological descriptions in Chad show us that 6-7kya, there was a large lake present in the region - which has been replaced by desert now.

However, these archives are non continuous and are patchy: we need to think of other archives.
- Tree rings can be used to count the width corresponding to amount of precipitation
- Lake sediment archives: mud collected deposit different type of fossils, allowing us to reconstruct the climate over up to millions of years
- Ice cores can be used to measure gas trapped in it, from thousands of years ago. Methane (CH4 and CH2) can be traced up to 800,000 years ago, before (considerable) human effects. 
- These records are known as a **proxy**. The temperature of the water acts as a proxy for another variable, such as much snow there was. *Modern research allows us to calibrate this*
Unless we have this record, we cannot contextualise the data.

We may want quantitative & numerical data, or a more ecological interpretation based on how many species are present.

**Stratigraphy** refers to analysing layers in the earth, such as under a lake. We can then combine this with e.g. pollen data and the depth to determine both amount of biodiversity and when this was.

### Natural vs anthropogenic drivers
We need to “disentangle” the human from natural changes. 

Pollution, such as radiation, wastewater, microplastics can be used to mark the boundary between more natural changes and human-induced changes. This is why some geologists argue there is a new epoch (Anthropocene)

For us to understand the past and future, we need to understand the current drivers of change and how this varies at different intervals. 

### Historic impacts on humans

#### Mexico
Based on lake sediment archives, levels of precipitation can be determined
- During the archaic and pre-classic period, there were periods of dry weather and also severe floods, disrupting the hunter-gather lifestyle.
- During the mid-classic, evidence from the types of algae present (indicative of higher water levels) meant that agriculture in the region was more favourable - maize cultivation was more used
- After this period (post-classic), precipitation decreased and there was a shift to drier conditions, making the transition to these new crops difficult - people moved around to find more favourable conditions.
We can infer from this that it affected civilisations and their demise, with different types of agriculture  

#### Glacials-interglacials
Since the LGM (last glacial maximum), changes in the Earth’s orbit resulted in climate variability and warming, resulting in wetter conditions more suited for agriculture.

> The natural rhythm is around 800,000 years of glacial-interglacial.


## Indications of human impacts
Proxies indicative of humans are **spheroidal carbonaceous particles**. These are byproducts of fossil fuel combustion — not natural forest fires. They are proposed to identify the start of the anthropocene epoch. Because they are so small and emitted into the atmosphere, they are widespread: they can be identified in lake sediments (which can be dated very precisely) and coral reefs. 

An example is Tasik Chini, Malaysia. When reading the sediment core record, and comparing this to other lakes, correlations can be mapped out.

The use of different proxies highlight different environmental changes: multiple lines of evidence are required to understand the changes that have occurred, and how this may be changed by humans.
