## Software Quality Management
Software quality management means doing every aspect well: good release testing, unit testing, good code. This only happens when everyone follows the same good practices. This is how high quality software is produced: only if quality measures are present at the start and throughout.

### QA testing
QA teams plan for quality (for project plans), define standards and procedures for the whole company, and check that projects conform to company standard of quality control (so no code is reduced below standard). 

> The QA process checks the projectâ€™s deliverables to ensure they are consistent with organisational standards and goals.

To do this, a **project quality plan** is required. It sets the bar for the team to achieve - everyone will know what is acceptable. It includes:
- intended use, who will be using it
- release dates and maintenance plans
- quality 

Quality is subjective, so standards are used. These may be:
- product standards: documentation standards, coding conventions

#### QA Inspections
In traditional inspections, a group of 


Inspections 


### Measuring quality
Non-functional requirements such as whether the software is reliable and secure need to be measurable as part of the quality plan - set with measurable goals. 

Subjective measures of quality can be inferred from objective metrics
