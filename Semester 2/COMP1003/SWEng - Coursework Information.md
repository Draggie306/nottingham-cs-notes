### This week
- Make a good test plan for unit testing
- Writing good quality tests for the classes and writing up the results (converting the test plan into a test report)
- Use git effectively, doing good coding practices (code review, conventions), documentation, linkage across the whole coursework.

Do not think: 1 person is doing Git, one person is doing code. Everyone must be involved. Think of a release pipeline and how 

Majority of marks will be how tests are made and code is integrated together.

> There is no expectation to work over Easter as work is made to be done in labs. However, it is possible to get ahead

### Marking Criteria

![[Pasted image 20250317091508.png]]
- Donâ€™t just do the testing, also write it into reports
- Must assign people to approve things

Consider everything about:
- issue, branching, merge requests, issues & templates, code review processes
- coding conventions, style of code, content of comments, structure of java files, naming of tests

Recommended to:
- create issues
- branches from issues
- then merge request (back into DEV branch)
- after all work is done, merge into main and tag

All should relate to each other and be updated together:
- issues
- .md docs
- code comments
- JUnit tests
