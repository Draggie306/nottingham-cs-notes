# Introduction 

Python
JavaScript
C
C++
Csharp
ARM Assembly


In PGA, we have learned about the imperative paradigm in C with variables, assignments, control structures, data structures, functions/parameters, pointers and memory management.

Object-oriented Programming will be in Java and Functional Programming will be in Haskell

## Schedule
There will be 4x 1-hour lectures weekly, further details are available on the module web page. 

There will be also 1 2-hour lab weekly, with help with exercises and coursework. It is split between 1 hour of Java and 1 hour of Haskell.

Everything will be added to the Moodle page 
### Textbooks
They are completely optional.
- Programming in Haskell by Graham Hutton - 20 copies available
 - Any Java book available in the library is good enough but equally online tutor

## Assessment
Java coursework (20%)

Haskell coursework (20%) - series of very short, 1-page exercise sheets weekly with 1 larger task/proper coursework towards the end of the module

Examination will be 60% at the end of the module.



## OO
OOP: thinking of a program as interacting objects.

Procedural decomposition: split a problem into sub-tasks, e.g. functions calling other functions.

In OO, we still have these functions and procedures, but we perform these on the objects.

It does make things a lot easier to do - e.g. easily re-use code and adapt it, which makes it easier to debug by localising them. As it makes complex things easier, we can do more with it.

Java checks a lot more than C. Things like checking of array bounds, management of memory lifetime (so no “free()”).

Procedural programming has difficulties: variables can be changed in many different places, can be difficult to ensure the code works reliably. 

OO programming adds things to procedural programs rather than taking away. This is more intuitive for larger, real-world programs by dividing it into interacting objects.

It provides ways to more easily reuse and adapt existing code. We can write less code, use code already debugged and made by someone else, **and produce full software more easily.** There are object types and classes that already exist, so we can just join them together in our own way. Good OO design means designing classes/objects for easy reuse by others.
