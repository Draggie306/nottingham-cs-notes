### Coursework 2c and 2d info
Courseworks 2c and 2d: set up to do the UI and controller at same time with matching functionality. Ordered in how Jason recommends how to do it.

Controller: rules
Model: data
View: what it looks like
These are all interfaces; abstract classes without implementations for the functions


ReversiController extends base class SimpleController but with the implementations and rule checking added.

Do not put data e.g. whoâ€™s turn it is in the view.

Build whole controller first *then* test it. 

TestYourController is more useful than TestYourGUIView

- an important thing is also that TestYourController checks feedback messages in the returned string
