#Predicates: parameterised #propositions

This pen is blue = proposition. Because the pen is a specific one, and is a True/False statement when evaluated.
X = 5 is NOT a proposition.

Predicates can be evaluated to T/F for any value of each variable. 

Predicates add parameters to propositions. All propositions are predicates (with no parameter).

Universal Quantification - true ”for all”. 
- For all -> an ‘A’ rotated 180 degrees
- ∀

∀ x ∈ X ( P(x) )

For all elements (x) in some set (X), the predicate ( P(x) ) holds true.


Existential quantification - true for at least one
- 

∃ 



Bound variable: Variable defined and used only within the formula, within the scope fo the operator and tie to it. (Like a local variable to a function).

Free variable: any used variable that is not bound. It may be a parameter or an input value. (like parameters to function). Something referenced in the predicate that is not bound.

Fresh variable: a variable that is not bound nor free, i.e. unused variable.
