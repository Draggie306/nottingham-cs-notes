## Recap

**Predicate**: a proposition that has a parameter, something that depends on something else, in the proposition. *Usually a free variable*

**Proposition**: true/false AND something without parameter.

**Universal** Quantification: true for all. Every one is true, for all. Counterexample: a value when P(x) is False. And any value for x that is False. (symbol: A rotated 180deg)

**Exist**ential Quantification: there exists one (EXISTential), at least one, element that is True. This is a **witness**. To prove it is not the case, then we just need one. 

> Universal quantification and existential quantification are opposites, in terms of de Morganâ€™s.

## New

For all will always be True regardless of what the predicate is if it is applied to the empty set. (Forall) s (in) empty set (P (s) )
This is called a Vacuous truth: a statement which is true because you are working over the empty set, automatically true because there are no elements.
