## RECAP
- Venn diagrams **must** show all areas and all possible intersections.
- Euler diagrams **do not** have to show all intersections. By doing this, we can immediately see relationships visually and more directly. 
> “The structure of the problem without taking any elements out”
- Union (similar to disjunction) means the elements in either set, OR.
- Intersection (similar to conjunction) means the elements only in both sets.
- Set Minus means all elements in A that are not in C, for A \\ C


### #Cardinality
Cardinality is the number of elements in the set.

It is always shown by vertical bars around the set, | {} |

| ∅ | = 0
| {∅} | = 1
| {3} | = 1
| {1,2,3} | = 3
| {3,3} | = 1


A #singleton is a set with one element (a cardinality of 1).

For any set in set-builder notation, we can enumerate the number of different elements, to work out its cardinality.

A intersection B means A AND B
A union B means A OR B

### Disjoint sets
If A


### Sets in sets - #subsets
