Entailment: multiple things can entail something

First assessment on Moodle. Do until get 100% on them. Mark matters
Best 7 out of 10 assessments count.
## Sets
A set is an unsorted/unordered collections of items, with no quantities. Don’t care about the quantities - only concept is what is/is not in a set. The item can be anything.

> An item is a member, or is not a member, of a set, independent of how many times it is. 

Can list (enumerate) items, and determine if it is or is not in the set (True/False).

There is NO ORDER or any other concepts. 

If a series has an order, or has quantity (multiple - i.e. shop inventory) then it is NOT a set.

### Standard set notation
Standard set notation, called set-builder notation, is used in many programming algorithms and maths to identify what is listed inside the set:

It is denoted with its contents inside curly brackets {} 
- { 1, 3, 5, 7 }

As quantity does not matter, maths says the following are equivalent:
- { 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 7, 5, 3 }

To determine if the element to the left of the operator is in the set to the right, we use the set membership operator.

## Venn and Euler Diagrams

### Venn
Overlapping (circles) with each other set that show set memberships depending on their relevant area/category.

Each possible overlap must be shown - cna get tricky with over 3 

### Euler
The same as Venn diagrams, but one that does not require that every overlap be shown. 

More easy to show set relationship. “There is no element in A that is in C, but there can be one in B”. It can also show that “Every element in B must be in A, but every element in A may not necessarily be in B”.

When in an exam, show the Euler diagram clearly by demonstrating that it does not overlap/empty overlaps can be removed.

- ℕ is the Set of natural numbers (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6…)
- ∈ means ”is in”

## Set membership and subsets
Subsets are sets that completely belong to another set


A strict subset is a set that must have at least one element in the original (e.g. A) that is not in the subset (e.g. B). A is strictly contained in B, but it cannot be equal. This is ⊂.

⊆ represents a subset; A can be equal or a strict subset of b.

## Intersection and union

The intersection is the set of elements that is of the place where the two overlap. This is the things in one AND the things in the other one.

The union is the set of elements in *either* two+ sets.

Others
The state of being implied with implication is equivalent to subsets. If A implies B, everything in B is a subset of A.

“not” in set theory requires a concept of relativity. Instead of enumerating everything that exists that is not in the set, we use **relative difference** (/set difference/set minus)

> A \\ B refers to the set of elements in A that are not in B

> “U” refers to “universe”, i.e. every number in the set. U \\ A means every number in the whole set that is not in subset A.
