## Proofs
For proofs, we don’t like disjunction (OR) - try to use implication 

For the premises, the approach is to work downwards one at a time to a conclusion. If this doesn’t work, try to prove by contradiction.

With AND, get 2 pieces of information.

Raise flag with implicaiton - 9/10 change or (disjunction) to implication. 

Flags can be seen as sub proofs -

#implication with true.

## Creativity and Intuition

If the format of the conclusion can be changed to make it easier, then do so.


> P if and only if Q is the same as P implies Q and Q implies P.

If have implication at the bottom, raise and implication flag.
