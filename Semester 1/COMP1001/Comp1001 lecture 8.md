”Easy marks”

In every stage on a ”proof table”, base all new lines on the lines above.
We are using reasoning repetitively in the proof.

In a statement, whether it involves #Entailment or #Implication then everything to the left of the operator is a premise. 

As soon as we reach a contradiction, we show that P is False, therefore the answer (to the right) is **not P** - this is proving the opposite.
