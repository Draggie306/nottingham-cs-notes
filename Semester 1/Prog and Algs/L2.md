## Lecture package info 
Look through the lecture package, get ahead and know that I do know/think about for the rest of the week of things that we don't know


Coursework 1 - due on 25th (given 2 weeks and a half). On the last week ending 25th, there will be no labs. 
Advice is to start early, do it ASAP. 

Coursework 2 will *not* be as easy and should be done next week, and not coursework 1 next week.

> Talk about the coursework, but not looking at others' work. 

Lab 1/2 form the basis of all coursework - 

Set up SSH access!!

Git commit -am


Pipeline is designed to commit and push repeatedly, not waiting until the code is completed

## C: Funcs, variables, operators 

Return 0 if correct, non -zero if there is an error or something had caused the program to exit early. 

> gcc -Wall -ansi -pedantic-errors -o exe input


When fixing C errors, fix the first one first, in the order they appear. 
All variables but be declared at the start of a function

4 basic data types in the standard library:
int, char, float, double

Function declaration: put above main but without main block of code that the function does, `int chercher(int x);`

If x % 2 == 0

### manuals
All C manuals in man 3 - e.g. `man 3 printf`
