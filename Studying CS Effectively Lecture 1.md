## 0. Note Taking
Still important to take notes
- Forced you to focus, understand and process.

Take notes before the lecture, about things you may not understand. 

Notes during the lecture are to understand the main gist of things. Take notes on questions that may be have.

After class, still important to refine and perhaps answer earlier questions

Methods - Cornell notes, outline (headings, smaller bullet points, individual facts to remember for exams or coursework).
Mindmaps - subdividing and matching concepts, visual. 

Doesn't matter what you use, act of thinking and active listening makes note taking powerful. 

> Handful of notebooks last entire degree!

Multitasking (listening )

Slides and PowerPoints are just a starting point! Has to be enriched with own understanding. Do this all the time - writing is a habit; more it is done, the easier it will be.

Review notes every week. Quizzing self, to answer exam questions.

## 1. Study motivation 

Need to do the right amount of effort, in the right way. The right direction.

Lots of stuff to learn by yourself to compliment what is learnt in the classroom. Lectures, labs, library, tutorials. 

Take notes to stop dozing off!

> Treat recordings as an additional asset, not a crutch.

Labs tutorials and seminars - use them all. 

Suffering together builds character and resilience in a support network. 

Ask someone who recently understood and form groups - group makes everything better when studying. Better to explain things is easier than any lecturer.

Being next, working on the same thing is easier than being alone. Coffee shop writing papers together lecturers - not even same paper.

Library tutorials - 1to1, study skills, writing skills course. Writing is a main part of computer science. Extra readings provided - more like extra help not extra work; they are for own good.

### Craftsman attitude
differentiates very good software engineers to 9-5 jobs.

Means: 
- focus on fundamentals and master them. These are the bricks to build from, if not understood then the rest will crumble.
- Practice and improve: daily low pressure practice is better than high stakes exam sprints 
- pay attention to detail and take pride in your work: e.g. publishing on GitHub. Not just adequate but something to be proud of is better.

Build stuff! Read, 2 weeks later is gone. Keep building to put into practice, do something with it .

> Brain is good at believing you understand something. Only can fully understand if make something and repeatedly use skill.


## 2. Year1

Aim is to prove you can make it through the course.

Grades are calculated for first year but do not count for the overall degree.

> Programmes = degree
> Module = course


However, grades show on transcript. Opportunities exist - internships, supervisor choice, staying on masters.

Knowledge is pyramid.

Allowed to make mistakes but still give 100%.

> **Even if fail and retake, the first mark will be visible.**

1. Lectures
- standard
- interactive
- In-person
2. Computing labs
- a32, online or in person 
- designed to 
3. Online lecture engagements
- 
4. Module based tutorials
- whiteboard based, a07, seminar rooms
- more practical time

Can be small, 15 people with direct engagement with lecture 

Weekly engagement with staff member

### lab times
30 hours per week of work, but 15hrs 

Labs always given priority in rooms 

## 3. Assessment and exams

Assessment either coursework or exam depending on what makes sense.

Exams run at the end of each semester, January and June. Typically 1-2hrs. Can be on weekend.

> Small knowledge quizzes and knowledge test - may count but very small percentage depending on lecturer

Larger modules and larger percentage are larger times. Most modules can be compensated apart from the main programming and algorithms - not the end of the world 

Coursework lasts a few days or weeks. Mostly programming but may be reports.

Supposed to do outside of timetabled time

Submit something always for coursework!

10 credits = 100 hrs of work, including all lectures and labs. This averages out overall. Think and allocate the right amount of effort.

Students with the best grade treat it like a 9-5 from day 1. 

> Just because no coursework, doesn't mean there's nothing to do.

Schedule important things first 


## 5. Using opportunities 

Always ask questions.

Use labs and do the work there then.

Labs to ask questions, not to work out what to ask.

Fixing and studying is better with pizza and coffee than in room. Informal groups e.g. tutor

## 6. Plagarism 
Heavily punished

Forgetting quotes, reusing code without citation, 

How you program, not how you use the machine to program.

Includes self plagiarism 

Can discuss the approach/process but not the actual work with others. 

Do not publish publicly at any time - people can copy and will be brought in for plagiarism talk. 

## senior tutor
Don't forget to use student services, support and wellbeing, 

## 9. Tech Setup 

Timetable may change from time to time - week with/without, check weekly.
