What that “MULTIPIÙ 200” tub actually is

200 g trichloro-isocyanuric acid tablets (“trichlor”) – ~90 % available chlorine.

Acidic (pH ≈ 2–3) and stabilised: every 1 ppm of free chlorine (FC) it adds also sneaks in ≈ 0.6 ppm of cyanuric acid (CYA). 


For your 70 m³ pool (18 500 gal):

1 × 200 g puck gives…	Maths

≈ 2.6 ppm FC	200 g × 0.90 ≈ 180 g pure Cl → 180 g ÷ 70 g ppm⁻¹ = 2.6 ppm 
≈ 1.6 ppm CYA	2.6 ppm × 0.6 ≈ 1.6 ppm extra CYA

How to fold trichlor into the routine

1 | Fix pH first (you’ve been sitting ~6.9)

Dissolve ≈ 320 g soda ash (your blue Nytra 1487) in a bucket, pour at a return, pump on 30 min. Re-test; target pH 7.2–7.4.


2 | Decide tonight’s chlorine goal

Situation	Dose	Result (FC / CYA)

Just daily maintenance	1 puck in a floater or the skimmer basket	+ 2.6 ppm FC, + 1.6 ppm CYA
Mini-shock (weekly)	2–3 pucks (≈ 400–600 g)	+ 5–8 ppm FC, + 3–5 ppm CYA
Full algae-kill shock	Stick with dichlor granules (1.2 kg gave 10 ppm FC) or liquid bleach; you don’t want the huge CYA hit from 4-5 pucks	


> Timing: drop the puck(s) after sunset; run the pump all night so concentrated acidic water from the skimmer never stagnates.



3 | Daily keep-alive (until you buy plain liquid or cal-hypo)

1. Every sunset:

Test FC and pH.

If FC < 2 ppm → add 1 puck.

If FC ≥ 2 ppm → let the current puck keep dissolving.



2. Every 3-4 days: record how many grams of trichlor you’ve used → multiply by 0.008 to estimate how much CYA you’ve added (e.g. 600 g ≈ 5 ppm CYA).


3. Stop using trichlor once CYA hits 40–50 ppm. Switch to unstabilised chlorine so the sunlight shield doesn’t climb too high.



4 | What about the dichlor granules?

They’re perfect for one-off boosts while your CYA is still < 30 ppm.

Remember: never pour cal-hypo shock into a system that still has undissolved trichlor dust in the skimmer or feeder—the mix can flash. Stick to one family of chlorine per 24 h pump cycle.

Quick “when do I add what?” cheat-sheet

Product	Add when…	Typical amount for 70 m³

Trichlor puck	FC below 2-3 ppm, CYA < 40 ppm	1 puck ≈ 2.6 ppm FC
Soda ash	pH < 7.2	160 g raises ≈ 0.1 pH
Polyquat-60 algaecide	FC ≤ 5 ppm, clear water	190 mL weekly
Clarifier	Water looks dull after shock	220 mL, pump 6 h
Back-wash	Filter PSI ≥ +8 psi over clean	2-3 min BW + 30 s rinse
Full shock (dichlor/liquid)	Each week or CC > 0.5 ppm	10 ppm FC at sunset

Tomorrow morning targets

Parameter	Sweet spot

FC	2–4 ppm
CC	< 0.2 ppm
pH	7.2–7.6
CYA	20–30 ppm (watch it climb 1.6 ppm per puck)


Hit those numbers, and the pool stays crystal without the “where did my chlorine go?” drama.  Drop your test results tomorrow and we’ll keep tuning.
